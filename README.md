Demo Horror Game
Welcome to the demo of Sewer Shadows, a psychological horror adventure set in a post-apocalyptic underground world.

This is Part 1 of a larger story-driven game, focusing on world-building, tension, and immersive storytelling.

🎮 About the Game
In a forgotten sewer city beneath the surface, a group of five children defies the elders' warnings and explores a barricaded tunnel. Players switch between two groups, uncovering eerie paranormal events, strange sounds, and unexplained migraines as they navigate vents leading to an abandoned steamer room.

The demo builds tension slowly and ends with a terrifying climax.
